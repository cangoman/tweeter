        You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.

        I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.

        I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.
